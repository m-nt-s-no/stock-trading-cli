# Stock Trading CLI App
A command line interface app that simulates a stock trading account. The user's account has a $10,000 credit at the start of the application and an empty portfolio. Users can buy or sell (a limited amount of made-up) stocks. Users can also view the stocks in their portfolio. The stock prices shift randomly, approximating the price action of a real stock market.

# Usage
Run `ruby main.rb` in the terminal.

# Ruby version: 
`3.2.1`
